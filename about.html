    <h2> About Me!</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Jennifer Gonzalez. I'm a student at Amistad Highschool and I'm currently in my junior year. I have a strong interest in business and economics, and have been developing my skills in coding. Outside of class, I'm involved in my highschool volleyball team, Squash Haven, my family's business, and math tutoring. These activities has helped me become more responsible, hardworking, and enhanced my sense of teamwork. My goal is to pursue a career in business and economics, and I'm excited to see where my passion and skills take me.
